# Blogs and Tutorials

This is a list of blogs and tutorials that I created. 

### Tutorials
1. This is tutorial on [how to generate closed captions for your presentation video](http://sumonbis.github.io/BlogsAndTutorials/Tutorials/adding-closed-captions-in-video-talk.pdf). This is a nice way to add subtitles very easily for your talk. By adding the captions, you can reach more audiences who have difficulty with the audio.
